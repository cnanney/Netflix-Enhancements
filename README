# Netflix Details Link

This extension simply adds a details link to each item so you can instantly go right to movie info, or see an episode list, without having to first wait for the popover and then click on the title. This has always been an annoyance of mine since they redesigned the site.

This is based on a [userscript](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/142921) by [Matthew Puccerella](https://github.com/matthewpucc/FTFY) that rewrites the links to open the information page for the item instead of playing it. I thought it would be nice to have both links to play immediately or view the item details.

One of the advantages of creating a Chrome extension is that it enables me to listen for certain xmlhttprequests used for their infinite scrolling so I can process the newly-loaded covers.
