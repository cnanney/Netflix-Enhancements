# [Netflix Enhancements](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-enhancements/glefmeoggphbdgeddmnmhfejpiipcmlf)

This extension gives you the ability to:

1. Add a details link to each cover so you can instantly go right to movie info, or see an episode list, without having to first wait for the popover and then click on the title.
2. Add Rotten Tomatoes ratings to movie popups.

## Changelog

This was originally based on a [userscript](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/142921) by [Matthew Puccerella](https://github.com/matthewpucc/FTFY) that rewrites the links to open the information page for the item instead of playing it. I thought it would be nice to have both links to play immediately or view the item details.

One of the advantages of creating a Chrome extension is that it enables me to listen for certain xmlhttprequests used for their infinite scrolling so I can process the newly-loaded covers.
